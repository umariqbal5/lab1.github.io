If there is only IP and not TCP then following can be issues
1. Data Loss (in TCP data is sent by packges now and we can have check and balance. TCP is adding extra info in headers)
2. Duplication
3. Sequencing
4. Curruption


-----------

1. URI (Identifier)
2. URL (Locator)
3. URN (Name)
URI (Identifier) = URL (Locator) + URN (Name)

div center = 
margin : auto & specific width


if need to make block element as inline-element: 
display: inline-block;
e.g div{display: inline-block;} //all div will be on same line now and also can have with,height, marging and padding

- display: flex;

Positions
1. static
2 relative
3 absolute
4 fixed


Z-index decide the stack position of overlapped elements. less z-index means at bottom.


-float: right
for wrapping text arround image / can apply to any div, img or other box elements
for positioning element to right left bottom or top
block element becomes an inline element after applying float.
give specific width. otherwise block element tak full width according to its content if content is bigger enough. otherwise only tak epsace according to content.

-Clear:
its for stop the float which we want to get off. 
if image is float. if we want to not get effected one div or h1 by this. we can add clear to that div or h1


-Overflow: hidden:
if float element is going outside of its block element. then use overflow. it will expand container block element.


-Multi Column text layout just like news papers.
column-count:2
column-gap: 10px;
column-rule: 2px dotted blue;

java script array behave like stack and queue. we can add in front or back of array
var is not block scoped
let and cont are block scoped
const use for non changable values
undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. On the other hand, null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value
const cannot reassign. but we can change its values if its a object or array.
check variable type: typeof x
== checking only value
=== checking value and data type.

--> Very IMPORTANT question for INTERVIEWS
What is Closure, you should know how to explain it. and examples.
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-closures-simplified-d0d23fa06ba4


Example of Closure & also called Function Factory with closures
function makeadd(x){
return function (y){
	return x+y; // x is free variable here for this function
}
}
makeadd(2)(3); //Calling


--> No function overriding in Javascript. the last function will override previous if same name, even different signature
--> arguments Object: If there is no parameter in function,. but we pass arguments. it will automatically introduce "arguments" parameter.
	function sum(){
	arguments[1];	//all arguments
	arguments[2];
	}
--> "Rest" parameter  (ES6)
	function sum(x,y, ...more){
	more[1]; //all extra arguments
	more[2];
	}
